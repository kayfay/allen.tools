Welcome to my blog!

My old blog was running for about a year and was hosted on an AI-driven website manager called Wix.
The unpaid version was what I used for my business and hosted my blog, which didn't offer a database export. Why? :-(
Manually downloading all of the embedded math and statistical formulas, graphs, charts, data visualizations, and others
would have been another task to put on the heap of things I had going on and didn't come in high priority in comparison 
to my wants and needs, so it was a sad sacrifice to make. Wix's interface was difficult to print out PDFs of blog posts
moreover, I feared that frustrated many readers, so I opted to delete the site to asway negative associations to my name.

I will get back to blogging from my notebooks pretty soon here, I promise, and I'll throw up some old papers soon!
